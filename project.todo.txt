list of tasks for the project

features:
- local storage
	- remove state sharing between todo component and service (1st step - deep clone for getTodos())
- e2e tests
- make todos observable
- decompose to components

bugs:
-

-todo editing: direct references to input element
-todo editing: todo item stores editing state, which is appropriate for viewModel, 
	but not appropriate for Model 
-todo-data.service: find a way to eliminate this.todos hack (storing todos instance in service to prevent 
	object reference change, see descr at file)
