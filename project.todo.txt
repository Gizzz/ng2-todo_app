list of tasks for the project

features:

hacks:
- todo editing: direct references to input element
- todo editing: todo item stores editing state, which is appropriate for viewModel, 
	but not appropriate for Model 
- todo-data.service: find a way to eliminate this.todos hack (because of state sharing 
	between todo component and service, see descr at file)
- routing: when redirecting to root - "All" filter link doesn't get highlighted
	(this is also present in reference solution)
